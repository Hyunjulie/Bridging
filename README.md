# Everything-Can-Talk
Personal project aiming to make toys/animals/anything come to life with sound. Using tensorflow.js 

--- 

How cool would it be if you could listen to your drawing/toys talk? 
I will be creating an object detection application web application with tensorflow.js that gives you the sound of the thing you point to (etc. fire trucks pictures, cat pictures)
